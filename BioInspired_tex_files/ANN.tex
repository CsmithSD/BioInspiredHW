\section{Problem 17}
Apply the MLP network trained with the backprobagation learning algorithm to solve the character recognition task of Section 4.4.2

Determine a suitable network architecture and then test the resultant network sensitivity to noise in the test data.  Test different noise levels, from 5\% to 50\%

\subsection{Background}
Artificial Neural networks are inspired by the neural networks that are at work within the human body.  This problem gives a set of 8 different 12x10 grid of binary pixels.  The input patterns should be feed in thought the network as 120 different input options.


\subsection{Algorithm}
As the input layer receives the neural network, weights will be applied and a sigmoid activation function will determine the next hidden layers output.  This layer then feeds into the output layer which has a different set of weights.

After the input goes though the ANN, records of the output for the neurons will be recorded.  This will be used for the backprobagation of error.

\subsection{Results}
The neural network took a long while to figure out.  In fact a few bugs remain: the back propagation of the error didn't seem to work as the delta values where close if not already zero.
